Purge Timer is a simple browser addon that automatically closes all tabs when the timer ends. It is recommended as a study tool for taking mindful study-breaks when surfing the web. 
Simply set the timer on the Study Purge app before your study break. When the time ends, all your tabs will be closed, preparing you a blank slate for your next study session. 

It can be downloaded for free on the [chrome webstore](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/purge-timer/cipnifncnhpnophkinojcfeiljphmjfc).
This addon is in its very earliest version and will be updated more in the future.
