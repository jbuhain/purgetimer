What is Purge Timer?
Purge Timer is a simple browser addon that automatically closes all tabs when the timer ends. It is recommended as a study tool for taking mindful study-breaks when surfing the web. 
Simply set the timer on the Study Purge app before your study break. When the time ends, all your tabs will be closed, preparing you a blank slate for your next study session. 

Why make this addon?
I noticed that there isn't an addon that does this specific (quirky?) functionality and thought it would be fun to develop. 

Where is this addon available?
It can be downloaded for free on the [chrome webstore](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/purge-timer/cipnifncnhpnophkinojcfeiljphmjfc).
This addon is in its very earliest version and will be updated more in the future.

How to test the extension in Chrome: 
1) Download the "purgetimer-chrome-extension" folder in this repo.
2) Upload the addon folder via Chrome -> Extensions -> Manage Extensions -> Load Unpacked.
3) The addon should now be added to your extensions.

Major Updates:
